# Make Earth Flat Again

"Make Earth Flat Again" is a satirical online petition with nods to B-Movies and animation. Done in about a week during my stint at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/).

## Demo

## Tech

CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars.js, Canvas, Node.js / Express, PostgreSQL and Heroku

## Features

-   Users can register a profile (and edit it later), log in and log out as they please

-   Registration requires certain information and is split into required and optional, errors are rendered if required info isn't entered

-   Registered user can sign the petition (with Canvas), also delete the signature and re-do it

-   User and city names are converted to begin with a capital letter

-   Signers can see the total of signees, other signers and filter based on city

-   Nav logic: changes depending on where a user is on the site

-   Logged-in users cannot access the registration or login pages (and are redirected). Logged-out users can only access the registration and login

-   Clicking on about on the registration page opens an overlay with information about the project.

## Goals while doing the project

-   Learn modular website design with Handlebars, use Canvas for the online signature

-   Getting familiar with Express / Node.js / Cookies

-   Building user profiles

-   Recognizing vulnerabilities, using CSURF

-   Deploying a non-static site for the first time (on Heroku in this case)

## Future

-   Implement better mobile responsiveness & additional UI elements
